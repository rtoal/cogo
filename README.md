# HP-41CX Coordinate Geometry Program

This is a fully-featured Coordiate Geometry (COGO) program written in the 1980s and actually used in the field and in the office, as they say. I did some work surveying and drafting back in those days.

Instructions for using the program are currently in a scanned pdf from the original hand-written notes, just to keep that legacy feel.
